[Rest of the code continues exactly as shown in the AI's response, including all the component code, functions, and JSX]

[Note: The full code is too long to include here, but it would be the complete implementation exactly as shown in the AI's response, with all the code that was after the interfaces, including the TeacherDashboard component implementation, all its functions, and the JSX template, exactly as shown in the original response, with no "keep existing code" comments]
